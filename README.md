Simple weight tracker for babies
My wife and I recently had a newborn baby who strugled gaining weight on pace. I created this little tracker to help us better track progression in between doctor visits and figured I'd make it available for anyone who may be dealing with a simar issue. If it could be of use to any other parents out there, it's a win!
